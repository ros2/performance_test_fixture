Changelog for package performance_test_fixture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.2.1 (2024-09-06)
------------------
* Fix a warning when building on Ubuntu Noble. (`#26 <https://github.com/ros2/performance_test_fixture/issues/26>`_) (`#27 <https://github.com/ros2/performance_test_fixture/issues/27>`_)
  In particular, gcc 13.2 was complaining that we were
  accessing a pointer after a free.  And that was technically
  true; the calls to DoNotOptimize(ptr) were after the
  free.  Just move this before the free (when the ptr is still
  valid) to remove the warning, but still ensure that we don't
  optimize the pointer away.
